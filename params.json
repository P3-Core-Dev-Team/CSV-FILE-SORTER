Depending on the configuration, csvsorter can deal with different formats, separators, delimiters, various sorting presets, header and no header files.\r\n\r\nThe csvsorter program was developed as external sorting program for the [csvsimple](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/csvsimple) LaTeX-package.
