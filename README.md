CSV-Sorter
=========

The `csvsorter` program serves to sort CSV files.

It is a Java command-line program which
processes one CSV input file to one CSV output file
controlled by an XML configuration file. Depending on the configuration,
`csvsorter`  can deal with different formats, separators, delimiters,
various sorting presets, header and no header files.

The `csvsorter` program was developed as external sorting program for the 
[`csvsimple`](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/csvsimple)
`LaTeX`-package. But it can be used for any CSV sorting task.
